# Data-Driven Insights: Understanding and Predicting Credit Card Churn

## Overview
Like all businesses, credit card companies depend on the presence and accessibility of customers. However, they face a significant challenge in customer attrition. Thus, credit card companies continually seek ways to comprehend the factors leading to customer attrition and ideally predict it before it occurs.

Numerous efforts have been directed towards this goal. While many have yielded commendable results, they often fail to address the crucial question: "What factors influence credit card churn?"

This project aims to develop a predictive model to forecast churn and conduct a thorough examination of the factors influencing customer attrition. By doing this, we aim not only to anticipate customer behaviour but also to provide valuable insights that businesses can utilise to enhance customer retention and operational capabilities.

## Project Goals
- Predict credit card customer churn using machine learning models.
- Identify and analyse the factors influencing churn.
- Provide actionable insights for improving customer retention strategies.

## Methodology
- **Random Forest (RF):** Utilised to construct a predictive model capable of determining whether a customer is likely to churn or not.
- **Logistic Regression:** Employed to investigate what factors significantly contribute to the occurrence of attrition and how changes in these features influence churn likelihood.

## Why Use a Jupyter Notebook for This Project?
Jupyter Notebooks are ideal for this project because they allow for interactive data exploration, seamless integration of code and explanations, and clear visualisation of results.

## Key Findings
The notebook documents key insights on factors affecting churn, such as customer demographics, spending patterns, and account behaviours. These findings aim to support proactive decision-making in reducing attrition.
